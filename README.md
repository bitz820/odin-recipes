Recipe Project through Odin Project

The Current project involves applying basic skills learned today with HTML in order to set up a website that has multiple recipes on it.


Set project up through github by creating a new repository and adding it to my coding folder.  

Picked 5 recipes and set up an HTML set up for each page.  Linked all five from the Index to their own respective pages.  Formatted them similarly with Title, Description, Ingredients and Instructions.  Added photo representation to each individual page and a gif to the index page.  published .html work to github
