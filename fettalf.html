    <p><h3>Description</h3></p>

    <p><h4>This delicious Italian staple is made easy with just a few ingredients but never fails to please!  <em>READ ON</em> to find out how to please the whole family with the perfect recipe!</h4></p>
    <p>Here's How To Make It:</p>
     
    <p>This is one of those rich and decadent pasta dinner recipes that everyone will love.
     This recipe is made with homemade 4-ingredient Alfredo sauce and homemade pasta, if you can believe it! </p>
    
     <p> You can easily swap out the homemade pasta with dried store bought pasta to make it quick and easy.
     I also made this with my own homemade Cajun seasoning mix. You can easily use a store bought seasoning mix, but be aware that the salt levels will be different.
      Because the chicken is pounded flat and seasoned before getting browned, it is fork tender and full of flavor.</p>
    
    <p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>
        <ul>
            <li>8 ounces pasta
            <li>2 boneless skinless chicken breasts </li>

            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil </li> 
        </ul>

        <p><Strong>Alfredo Sauce</Strong></p> 
            <ul>
                <li>4 tablesppons butter</li>
                <li>4 cloves garlic minced</li>
                <li>1 1/2 cups heavy cream <em>(divided)</em></li>
                <li>2 cups parmesan cheese <em>(grated)</em></li>
            </ul>   
<p><h3>Instructions</h3></p>
    <p><ol>
        <li>First step is to get the pasta cooking in a pot of boiling salted water. </li>
        <li>Pound or roll the chicken breasts until they are about a half inch thick. </li>
        <li>Coat both sides with the Cajun seasoning. </li>
        <li>Cook in olive oil in a pan over high heat until each side is browned, then allow to rest on a plate that is loosely tented with foil.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, make the Alfredo sauce by infusing garlic in butter in the same pan you cooked the chicken. </li>
        <li>To that, you will add heavy cream, Parmesan cheese, and a bit more Cajun seasoning. </li>
        <li>Add the cooked pasta to the sauce and toss to coat. </li> 
        <li>Then, slice the cooked chicken and add the slices, along with any juices from the plate, to the pasta. Serve warm and enjoy!</li>
