    <h3>Descritpion</h3>
        <p>In France, French toast is called pain perdu—"lost bread," a nod to the fact that the dish works best with stale bread. More importantly, pain perdu isn't served at breakfast, but rather as a dessert, a reminder that this dish is traditionally soaked in sugar and cream. This version forgoes cream for milk, and a deluge of sugar for vanilla and a slug of bourbon. It's still a pretty decadent French toast recipe to start your day, but at least you won't need a nap afterward. (But you can take one anyway if you want to, we won't tell!)</p>
