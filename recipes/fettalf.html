        <p id="scripttext">This delicious Italian staple is made easy with just a few ingredients but never fails to please!  <em>READ ON</em> to find out how to please the whole family with the perfect recipe!  This is one of those rich and decadent pasta dinner recipes that everyone will love.  This recipe is made with homemade 4-ingredient Alfredo sauce and homemade pasta, if you can believe it! You can easily swap out the homemade pasta with dried store bought pasta to make it quick and easy.  I also made this with my own homemade Cajun seasoning mix. You can easily use a store bought seasoning mix, but be aware that the salt levels will be different.  Because the chicken is pounded flat and seasoned before getting browned, it is fork tender and full of flavor.
