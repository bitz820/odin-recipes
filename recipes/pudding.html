            <div class="cpheaderformat">Description</div> 
                <p id="scripttext">Packaged chocolate pudding contains more additives and fillers than actual chocolate, and purchased premade pudding contains more calories than one should ever consume with a spoon. What's a chocoholic to do? The answer: Make an elevated version of the classic treat at home. Trust us, ours is a far cry from the plastic cup you might be familiar with. This homemade chocolate pudding recipe skips the eggs, which doesn't just cut calories, but also saves you from having to slow-cook them in a double boiler or temper them with hot chocolate. What really makes this pudding special, though, is the final flourish. It might sound like a strange way to eat dessert, but the sweet-salty combination of chocolate, peppery olive oil, and crunchy little flakes of salt brings to mind a bag of chocolate-covered pretzels. Who could resist that?
